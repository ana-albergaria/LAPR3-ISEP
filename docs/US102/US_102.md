### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

The present US is held many times during the business. As the traffic manager does his daily work, he will probably come across with the need to search for ship details many times.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: asks to ............... |	... interacting with the actor? | .........UI | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| | ... coordinating the US? | ...........Controller | Controller |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| | ... | ... | ... |
| Step 8: informs operation success | ... informing operation success? | ...........UI | IE: is responsible for user interactions. |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* .....
* .....

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ..........
* ..........
* ..........

# 4.1 Report

Tests 1 to 2 follow this model:

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void .....(){
        .............;
