## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a **traffic manager** I wish to **make a Summary of a ship's movements.**

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**
>Ships are characterized by:
>- MMSI: unique 9-digit ship identification code.
>- Ship name.
>- Ship identification according to the IMO identification.
>- ...
>- Dynamic data fields relating to a ship's positioning data:
>- Base Date Time: date/time of AIS message.
>- Latitude
>- Longitude
>- Speed over ground (SOG).
>- Course over ground (COG): direction relative to absolute North (in degrees: [0; 359]).
>- Heading: ship heading (in degrees: [0; 359], 511 indicates 'not available').
>- Position: ship code in tow.
>- Transceiver Class: class to transceiver used when sending data.

**From the client clarifications:**

>Q1: How shold the ship be selected, from MMSI code, name or IMO?
>
>A2:

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** For a given ship return in an appropriate structure one of its codes
  (MMSI, IMO or Call Sign), Vessel Name, Start Base Date Time, End
  Base Date Time, Total Movement Time, Total Number of Movements,
  Max SOG, Mean SOG, Max COG, Mean COG, Departure Latitude,
  Departure Longitude, Arrival Latitude, Arrival Longitude, Travelled
  Distance (incremental sum of the distance between each positioning
  message) and Delta Distance (linear distance between the coordinates of
  the first and last move).

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a depencency with the craetion of a Ship object, and also with the existence of a Traffic manager role to exist be registered.

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Asks to make a Summary of a ship's movements.        |	        ... knowing the ship's movements?		  |Ship                         | IE: The ship object knows it's own movements.        |
| Step 2: Asks what ship's code to search for                  |			n/a				                          |                             |                                                      |
| Step 3: Types requested data		                          |			... knowing which ship to search by the code? | ShipsBST                    | IE: The ship's search tree know it's ships    |
| Step 4: Returns a summary of the searched ship's movements |			...summarize the ships movements?            | ShipMovement               | IE: The shipMovements object knows it's own data to perform the neeeded calculations with it.|              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Ship
* ShipMovement

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ShipBST
* ShipMovementsBST

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

###4.1 TestType instances values:
**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the TestType class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}
**Test 2:** Check if it's not possible to create a Test Type with empty field for each attribute.
**For Example:**

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void ensureTestTypeCodeIsNotEmpty() {
        TestType instance = new TestType("", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
    }


**Test 3:** Check if it is not possible to create a Test type with each attribute's lenght not following the specified criteria.
>* **AC1:** The code must have 5 alphanumeric characters
>* **AC2:** Description must be a string with no more than 15 characters.
>* **AC3:** Collecting Method must be a string with no more than 20 characters.

**For Example:**

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void ensureTestTypeCodeIsNotMoreThanFiveCharacteres() {
        TestType instance = new TestType("AAA123", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
    }

**Test 4:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the TestType class with code holding not alphanumeric characters.

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
     public void ensureTestTypeCodeIsAlphanumeric() {
        TestType instance = new TestType("AA23@", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
     }

##4.2 TestTypeStore

**Test 10:** Check that it is not possible to save a repeated Test Type in the store
* Same Object
* Different Object, same code
  **For Example:**


    @Test
    public void ensureTestTypeIsNotSavedRepeatedWithSameObject() {
        TestType t1 = company.getTestTypeStore().createTestType("AAA23", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
        company.getTestTypeStore().saveTestType(t1);
        boolean actual = company.getTestTypeStore().saveTestType(t1);
        assertFalse(actual);
    }

**Test 11:** Check that it is not possible to save a null Test Type in the store

    @Test
    public void ensureTestTypeIsNotSavedIfNull() {
        System.out.println("ensureTestTypeIsNotSavedIfNull");
        assertFalse(company.getTestTypeStore().saveTestType(null));
    }

**Test 12:** Check that it is not possible to get the test types by code with not assigned codes

    @Test(expected = UnsupportedOperationException.class)
    public void ensureGetWithInvalidTestTypeCodeThrowsException() {
        System.out.println("ensureGetWithInvalidTestTypeCodeThrowsException");
        TestTypeStore testTypeStore = company.getTestTypeStore();
        TestType t1 = testTypeStore.createTestType("AAAA1", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
        TestType t2 = testTypeStore.createTestType("AAAA2", "blood analysis", "needle", pcList);
        testTypeStore.saveTestType(t1);
        testTypeStore.saveTestType(t2);
        List<String> codeList = new ArrayList<String>();
        codeList.add("AAAA1");
        codeList.add("AAAAA");

        testTypeStore.getTestTypesByCode(codeList);
    }

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

## Class CreateTestTypeController

    public boolean createTestType(String code, String description, String collectingMethod, List<String> selectedCategoriesCodes){
        ParameterCategoryStore parameterCategoryStore = this.company.getParameterCategoryStore();
        List<ParameterCategory> selectedCategories = parameterCategoryStore.getCategoriesByCode(selectedCategoriesCodes);
        this.testType = this.company.getTestTypeStore().createTestType(code, description, collectingMethod, selectedCategories);
        return this.company.getTestTypeStore().validateTestType(testType);
    }

    //...Omitted
    
    public boolean saveTestType(){
        return this.company.getTestTypeStore().saveTestType(testType);
    }

## Class TestTypeStore

    public TestType createTestType(String code, String description, String collectingMethod, List<ParameterCategory> selectedCategories){
        return new TestType(code, description, collectingMethod, selectedCategories);
    }

    //...Omitted
    
    public boolean validateTestType(TestType testType){
        if (testType == null)
            return false;
        return !this.testTypeList.contains(testType);
    }

    public boolean saveTestType(TestType testType){
        if (!validateTestType(testType))
            return false;
        return this.testTypeList.add(testType);
    }
*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

To create a Test type, it is necessary to know the list of parameter categories available in the system.
Therefore, in order to reduce coupling, it was created a CategoriesDTO as well as a CategoriesMapper to process the data and convert the list of parameter categories to a Dto.


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
