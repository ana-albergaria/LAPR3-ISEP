# 4. Tests

### FreightNetwork class

**Test 1:** Test to ensure getOrderedCapitalsList() is functioning correctly.

- an expected list with all the capitals and its colors
- the list through calling the method 
- checks whether the lists are equal


**Test 2:** Test to ensure getCapitalsToColor() is functioning correctly.

- an expected map with all the capitals and colors set to null
- the map through calling the method
- checks whether the maps are equal


**Test 3:** Test to ensure colorMap() is functioning properly

Situation 1: 
- an expected map with all the capitals and colors
- the map through calling the method
- checks whether the maps are equal

Situation 2:
- the expected minimum colors to be used
- obtain the minimum colors actually used
- checks whether the number of colors are equal

Situation 3: (**for each capital**)
- through the map containing the capitals and colors, obtain the **submap** containing **only** the neighbouring countries of the capital to be tested
- obtain the color of the capital to be tested
- check if the subMap does **not** contain the color of the capital to be tested, meaning **none of the neighbouring countries of the country being tested have the same color of it**


### ColorMapController class

**Test 1:** Test to ensure colorMap() is functioning correctly.

- an expected map with all the capitals and colors set to null
- the map through calling the method
- checks whether the maps are equal
