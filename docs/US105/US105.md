### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | TopNUI  |
| 			  	 |	... coordinating the US? | TopNController | Controller                             |
| 	Step 2		  	 |   |   |  |
|   Step 3 		 |	...saving the inputted data? | ShipStore | IE: ShipStore uses data.  | 
|  	Step 4	 |	...return list of ships?  | ShipStore| ShipStore gathers the ship's info accordingly with the initial and final Base Date Time.|

# 4. Tests


    public class PerformanceStoreTest {

    PerformanceStore performanceStore = new PerformanceStore();
    Date start = new Date("2021/5/10");
    Date end = new Date("2021/5/20");

    @Test
    public void getTests() { performanceStore.getTests(1, start, end ); }
    @Test
    public void getTests2() { performanceStore.getTests(2, start, end); }

    @Test
    public void getStatistics() { performanceStore.getStatistics(start, end); }

    @Test
    public void createArray() { performanceStore.createArray(start, end); }
    }




# 5. Construction (Implementation)

## Controller

    public class PerformanceController {

    public void getStatistics(Date start, Date end){
        
    }

    public int[] getSubarray(int option, Date start, Date end){
        
    }
    }


## UI
    public class PerformanceUI implements Runnable {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        boolean bol=false;
        
            *ask start date*

            *ask end date*

            controller.getStatistics(startDate, endDate);
            boolean bol1=false;
            int option;

            
                *choose algorithm*

                if (BruteAlgorithm){
                   *print max sum array*
                }else if (SUM){
                    *print max array*
                }else System.out.println("Insert a valid option");

      }
    }


## Store

    public class PerformanceStore {

    public int[] getTests(int option, Date start, Date end){
        *get max sum array with chosen algorithm*
    }


    public void getStatistics(Date start, Date end){
       *statistics for days, weeks, months and years*
    }

    public int[] createArray(Date start, Date end){
        *create array to be analysed by algorithms*
    }

    }



# 6. Integration and Demo

* A new option to the Administrator Menu was added.
* After logging in as an Administrator, you need to select the "Check Performance" option to proceed.

# 7. Observations

* The statistics must show four graphics for the number of clients, registered tests, tests with results and validated tests.
* One graphic for days, one for weeks, one for months and one for years.
